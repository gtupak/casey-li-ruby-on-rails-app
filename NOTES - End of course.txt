Notes

{
DON’T WORRY ABOUT DOING IT RIGHT AND DON’T LET THE THOUGHT OF DOING IT WRONG PARALYZE YOU.

IT’S BETTER TO JUST DO IT AND EVENTUALLY DEVELOP AN YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT IT THEN TO HAVE SOMEONE TELL YOU THAT ‘THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT’.

RAILS HAS THIS BUILT IN BECUASE MOST OF THE TIME ‘THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT’ IS THE SHORTEST WAY TO DO IT
